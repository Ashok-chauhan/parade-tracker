    <p><p>The 2017-18 school year is officially a thing of the past in St. Joseph, as the St. Joseph School District Board of Education hosted its final meeting of the fiscal year on Monday.</p></p> <p><p>The board made short work of a lengthy agenda, which included several miscellaneous items that had been the topics of discussion in recent weeks but still required final board approval.</p></p> <p><p>Monday was the final meeting before Superintendent Dr. Doug Van Zyl begins his contract with the district on July 1. Though the board typically takes a month off from meetings in July, it plans to host its first official meeting with Van Zyl on Thursday, July 19.</p></p> <p><p>“There wasn’t a lot on the agenda tonight. Most of what it was, was cleaning up business here at the end of the fiscal year and getting ready to transition into the new fiscal year,” said Seth Wright, school board president. “We’re all excited to get Dr. Van Zyl on board and get to work.”</p></p> <p><p>Among the business on Monday was the approval of a bid for a third-party company to supply special education teachers for the 2018-19 school year, the appointment of Dr. Gabe Edgar as board treasurer and a long list of new and revised board policies.</p></p> <p>
   
   
   
   <p>Third-party SPED teachers</p></p> <p><p>District administrators presented bid results for special education teachers to the board at its work session on June 11. On Monday, the board approved the administration’s recommendation to contract with the lowest bidder.</p></p> <p><p>That bidder was a nationwide company called Delta-T Group, whose low bid of $40 an hour per teacher beat out six other bids.</p></p> <p><p>The board’s final approval of a contract comes after it came to light in May that the district was having trouble filling about 15 special education jobs.</p></p> <p><p>Since then, the number of special education vacancies has been reduced to fewer than 10. The district will continue to recruit applicants through the summer, but Director of Special Services Dr. Denise Colhour told the board at the work session earlier this month that the district had “exhausted” its local recruitment efforts.”</p></p> <p><p>The $40 an hour bid from Delta-T, Colhour said, came in about $20 cheaper than she had initially expected.</p></p> <p><p>Dr. Gabe Edgar</p></p> <p><p>Finance Director Wes Metz was absent from Monday’s meeting, where the board appointed his replacement, Dr. Gabe Edgar, as treasurer.</p></p> <p><p>Edgar wasn’t in attendance Monday, either, but he will begin as the district’s new finance director on July 1.</p></p> <p><p>The district announced in May that it had hired Edgar to replace Metz, who announced his resignation in April. Metz is moving into a similar role with the Lee’s Summit School District.</p></p> <p><p>Edgar is coming to St. Joseph from the Marceline R-V School District in North Central Missouri, where he served most recently as superintendent, as well as a middle and high school principal.</p></p> <p><p>New and revised board policies</p></p> <p><p>The board voted to make changes to 24 board policies on Monday.</p></p> <p><p>Some are new, like the suicide awareness and prevention policy required by state law, and some were revised, like the at-risk students policy.</p></p> <p><p>All but one policy change Monday was approved unanimously.</p></p> <p><p>Policy “DCB — Political Campaigns” had been completely revised to better define what the district and personnel can and cannot do related to ballot issues and campaigns. However, it didn’t go through the policy process.</p></p> <p><p>Board member Lori Prussman opposed the policy’s approval because it required the board to suspend policy process to give it the green light on Monday.</p></p> <p><p>Policy process, defined in policy BF, requires that new and revised policies be presented to the Board Policy Committee, then be presented twice for consideration to the board of education before it can be approved.</p></p> <p><p>Prussman offered no comment after the meeting but said during the meeting she didn’t want to make a habit of suspending the board’s policy process to approve a single policy.</p></p> <p><p>Wright said the district had been working on the policy with its legal counsel on its own accord to clarify what the district can and should do with respect to political campaigns.</p></p> <p><p>He said the policy’s route to approval Monday was more of a “procedural issue” to ensure it was approved properly.</p></p> <p><p>It’s a pertinent policy change, as the district finds itself in an ongoing lawsuit related to its marketing of Proposition 1, a tax levy initiative that failed at the polls in November.</p></p>
